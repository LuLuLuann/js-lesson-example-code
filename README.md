Beginner's JavaScript examples to help you understand the code. 

The CSS & HTML don't really have much on them. The HTML just links to the JS pages. 

The focus is on the JavaScript.

All JS pages are commented out. 

You can uncomment each part if you want to see how the examples work:

 1. This is the CODE ALONG javascript page for class. --> learning.js

 2. This is the CODE ALONG MATH javascript page for class. 
 --> math.js 

 3. This is the CODE ALONG "COMPARISON OPERATORS" javascript page for class.
 --> comparison-operators.js

 4. This is the CODE ALONG "LOGICAL OPERATORS" javascript page for class.
 --> logical-operators.js# js-lesson-example-code
